This repository contains my work from my final year project which was the research and implementation of 
two specific algorithms that identify whether a graph is a comparability graph or not, and the orientations
of the edges that are produced when the algorithm is successful.

The pdf report (Final_year_project (1).pdf) can be found in the repository defines what a comparability graph and explains all the research, 
implementation, and results.
